    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2><br>

    <p>Hi i am Codjia loic, i was born in 1997 in ivory coast located in West Africa and a french speaking country.
        As far as can remember growing up, i have always been a really <q>energetic</q>person. Being a single child, my childhood was
        pretty peaceful; so it gave me time to enjoy things which lead me to my first love <em>MANGA.</em>
    </p>
    <p>When is was thritheen or fourtheen, i had a huge accident playing with my friend, i was running and i ran trough a glass door which gave that huge scar on my face. 
        About two <sup>cm</sup> close the the left eye and almost ten <sup>cm </sup> in lenght, i could have been blind from one eye wearing an eye patch like the pirates in old movies and cartoon.
    </p>
