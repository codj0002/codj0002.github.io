        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>Hi i am <em>Codjia loic</em>, i was born the 4<sup>th</sup> december 1997 in <mark>Ivory Coast</mark> located in West Africa, a french speaking country.
        As far as can remember growing up, i have always been a really <q>energetic</q>kid. Being a single child, my childhood was
        pretty peaceful,so it gave me time to discover things! And that's how i found my first love <strong>MANGA.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>When I was thriteen or fourteen,i had a huge accident playing with my friend,I was running and passed trough a glass door giving me that huge scar on my face. 
     About two cm close the the left eye and almost ten cm in lenght, I could have been looking Nick Fury,a badass spy with an eye-patch.
