    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>Hi i am <em>Codjia loic</em>, i was born in 1997 in <mark>Ivory Coast</mark> located in West Africa and a french speaking country.
        As far as can remember growing up, i have always been a really <q>energetic</q>person. Being a single child, my childhood was
        pretty peaceful,so it gave me time to enjoy things, which lead me to my first love <strong>MANGA.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>When is was thritheen or fourtheen,i had a huge accident playing with my friend,i was running and i passed trough a glass door which gave that huge scar on my face. 
        About two <sup>cm</sup> close the the left eye and almost ten <sup>cm </sup> in lenght, i could have been blind from one eye wearing an eye patch like the pirates in old movies or cartoons.
