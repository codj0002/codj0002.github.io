        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>Hi i am <em>Codjia loic</em>, i was born the 4<sup>th</sup> of december 1997 in <mark>Ivory Coast</mark> located in West Africa and a french speaking country.
        As far as can remember growing up, i have always been a really <q>energetic</q>person. Being a single child, my childhood was
        pretty peaceful,so it gave me time to enjoy things, which lead me to my first love <strong>MANGA.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>When is was thriteen or fourteen,i had a huge accident playing with my friend,i was running and i passed trough a glass door which gave that huge scar on my face. 
     About two cm close the the left eye and almost ten cm in lenght, I could have been looking Nick Fury, badass with an eye-patch.
